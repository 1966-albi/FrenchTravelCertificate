# EULA

Applicable from: 12 April 2020

(Note: all the clauses contained in this agreement are considered known, therefore you have to read them entirely)

This End-User Licence Agreement (“EULA”) constitutes an agreement between you and Paul SOUTEYRAT (herein referred to as the “Owner”) with regard to the "Travel certificate" (also called "Attestation de déplacement" in French) Application for Android (herein referred to as “Software Product”, “Software”, or simply “The Application”). By installing the Software, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this licence agreement.

Your use of the Software (as specified below) is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this EULA. If you do not accept the terms of this EULA, do not install (or uninstall) the Software.

## 1. License

The Software is licenced, not sold. The Owner grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and licence to use one copy of the Software for your personal non-commercial use on a single device. The rights granted herein are subject to your compliance with this EULA. The Software is being licenced to you and you hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership in the Software is being transferred or assigned and this EULA is not to be construed as a sale of any rights in the Software. You may see the full license (only available in english) of the source code at: https://github.com/PeredurOmega/FrenchTravelCertificate/blob/master/LICENSE

## 2. Restrictions of use

Unless the Owner has authorized you to distribute the Software, you shall not make or distribute copies of the Software or transfer the Software from one device to another. You shall not decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, include in other software, or translate the Software, or use the Software for any commercial purposes. You shall not modify, alter, change or otherwise make any modification to the Software or create derivative works based upon the Software. You shall not rent, lease, resell, sub-licence, assign, distribute or otherwise transfer the Software or this licence. Any attempt to do so shall be void and of no effect.

## 3. Copyrights

You acknowledge that no title to the intellectual property in the Software is transferred to you. You further acknowledge that title and full ownership rights to the Software will remain the exclusive property of the Owner, and you will not acquire any rights to the Software. You shall not remove or obscure the Owner\'s copyright, trade mark or other proprietary notices from any of the materials contained in this package or downloaded together with the Software.

## 4. Disclaimer of warranty

The Software is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind. We disclaim and make no express or implied warranties and specifically disclaim the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement of third-party rights. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Software is with you. We do not warrant that the functions contained in the Software will meet your requirements or that the operation of the Software will be error-free.

## 5. Limitation of liability

In no event will the Owner be liable for special, incidental or consequential damages resulting from possession, access, use or malfunction of the Software, including but not limited to damages to property, loss of goodwill, computer or mobile device malfunction and, to the extent permitted by law, damages for personal injuries, property damage, lost profits or punitive damages from any causes of action arising out of or related to this EULA or the Software, whether arising in tort (including negligence), contract, strict liability or otherwise and whether or not the Owner has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Because some states/countries do not allow certain limitations of liability, this limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction. This limitation of liability shall not be applicable solely to the extent that any specific provision of this limitation of liability is prohibited by any federal, state, or municipal law, which cannot be pre-empted. This EULA gives you specific legal rights, and you may have other rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

In no event shall the Owner’s liability for all damages (except as required by applicable law) exceed the actual price paid by you for use of the Software (supported by an invoice).

## 6. Privacy

The Software can not collect any in-app data for sending it to an other server or device. Your info in your profile and your certificates are fully stored in the internal storage of your device and are not and can not be sent to any device, person or institution. The Software may still collect data to detect bugs and especially to know when the app crashes. But all data are anonymized and are just used for the purpose of improving the Software. The Software may also collect the number of "app launches" for statistical purposes.

## 7. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Owner harmless from and against any and all damages, losses and expenses arising directly or indirectly from: (i) your acts and omissions to act in using the Software pursuant to the terms of the EULA; or (ii) your breach of this EULA.

Finally, everyone involved in the creation of this application, wishes you to stay safe (and home as long as much as possible). We hope you will use this application wisely.
